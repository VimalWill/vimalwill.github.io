      abs = {The rapid advancement in AI architectures and the proliferation of AI-enabled systems have intensified the need for domain-specific architectures that enhance both the acceleration and energy efficiency of AI inference, particularly at the edge. This need arises from the significant resource constraints-such as computational cost and energy consumption-associated with deploying AI algorithms, which involve intensive mathematical operations across multiple layers. High-power-consuming operations, including General Matrix Multiplications (GEMMs) and activation functions, can be optimized to address these challenges. Optimization strategies for AI at the edge include algorithmic approaches like quantization and pruning, as well as hardware methodologies such as domain-specific accelerators. This paper proposes TYTAN: TaYlor-series based non-linear acTivAtion eNgine, which explores the development of a Generalized Non-linear Approximation Engine (G-NAE). TYTAN targets the acceleration of non-linear activation functions while minimizing power consumption. The TYTAN integrates a re-configurable hardware design with a specialized algorithm that dynamically estimates the necessary approximation for each activation function, aimed at achieving minimal deviation from baseline accuracy. The proposed system is validated through performance evaluations with state-of-the-art AI architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers. Results from system-level simulations using Silvaco's FreePDK45 process node demonstrate TYTAN's capability to operate at a clock frequency >950 MHz, showcasing its effectiveness in supporting accelerated, energy-efficient AI inference at the edge, which is ~2 times performance improvement, with ~56% power reduction and ~35 times lower area compared to the baseline open-source NVIDIA Deep Learning Accelerator (NVDLA) implementation.},

      abs = {The notion of a Brain-Computer Interface system is the acquisition of signals from the brain, processing them, and translating them into commands. The study concentrated on a specific sort of brain signal known as Motor Imagery EEG signals, which are activated in the brain without any external stimulus of the needed motor activities in relation to the signal. The signals are further processed using complicated signal processing methods such as wavelet-based denoising and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) based dimensionality reduction approach. To extract the characteristics from the processed data, both signal processing includes Short-Term Fourier Transforms (STFT) and a probabilistic approach such as Gramian Angular field Theory are used. Furthermore, the gathered feature signals are analyzed and converted into noteworthy commands by Deep Learning algorithms, which can be a mix of complicated Deep Learning algorithm families such as CNN and RNN. The Weights of trained model with the particular subject is further used for the multiple subject which shows in the elevation of accuracy rate in translating the Motor Imagery EEG signals into the relevant motor actions},
